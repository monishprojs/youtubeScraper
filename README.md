What this does:
- Returns viewcount of the first video on the for your page of youtube

Few guidelines to use this:
- Install chromedriver, and insert it's location on your computer into PATH
- WebDriver.Wait is used to ensure that the item we are looking for on the html has loaded before we try to access it
-Time.sleep is used purely for aesthetic purposes of being able to see the pages load, if you want to achieve a faster run time feel free to remove it from the code
